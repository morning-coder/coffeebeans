This is the question that forced me to open up RD Sharma book and google some formulaes. This is heavy maths question about polygon, side and angles.

Regular polygon we are considering sideCount > 3 with 3 co-ordinates given.

1. First task is to compute length of sides of polygon from the given coordinates.
2. Calculate circumradius of triangle formed from co-ordinates.
3. Calculate angles between the sides.
4. Calculate count of sides present in polygon
5. Calculate min area possible in polygon.

Maintained two classes for loose coupling and better abstraction.
